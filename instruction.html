<p>Watch two short video clips of an Artificial Intelligence trying to do a backflip. The goal is to jump, rotate backwards, and successfully land. We record short clips showing AI's actions. You need to choose a clip that represents better AI behaviour. You can find an example of a backflip below. Note that AI uses your feedback and tries to do better. You might notice this after a while.</p>

<h3>Steps to Complete the Task</h3>
<p>1. Press button ► on the left video and next on the right video.</p>
<p>2. Choose&nbsp;<strong>Failed to load</strong>&nbsp;if:</p>
<ul>
   <li>One of the videos didn't load</li>
   <li>Button ► is not active</li>
   <li>Instead of the video player there is a text saying «Failed to load»</li>
   <li>Video is deleted</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Use buttons 1, 2, 3 and arrows on your keyboard to complete tasks faster.</p>
<h3>How to Judge</h3>
<div>You need to choose the closest behavior to a successful backflip.&nbsp;However, the AI <b>only learns</b> how to play games so its behaviour can be very far from perfect. In this case try to choose clips showing that AI <b>is making attempts </b>(maybe unsuccessful) to do something. Also, you might see a situation when both clips represent a successful play. In this case try to choose <b>aesthetically better </b>behaviour. But, generally, at first, AI just does random actions and more likely laying on the ground. It is crucial, to provide a feedback on successful attempts of doing <i>something</i> useful. For example, you need to prefer clips where AI tries to at least stand on the ground over ones where it just falls down; clips where AI just jumps without doing a backflip over ones where it just stands on the ground, etc.</div>
